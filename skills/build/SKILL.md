description: Run the dev/eval loop for an implementation. Reads the active spec branch's tasks.md, picks the next phase with unchecked items, delegates implementation to the developing-features subagent and verification to the evaluating-phases subagent, and iterates until every task in every phase is checked. Use after /tasks has produced specs/NNN-<slug>/tasks.md.

# Build

Implement every phase from the active spec branch's `tasks.md`. Each phase loops through developer → evaluator until the evaluator passes.

## Configuration

Model assignment per subagent. Change these to control cost/quality tradeoffs:

| Subagent              | Model                              | Rationale |
|-----------------------|------------------------------------|-----------|
| developing-features   | $DEVELOPER_MODEL (default: sonnet) | Heavy code generation — sonnet balances speed and quality |
| evaluating-phases     | $EVALUATOR_MODEL (default: sonnet) | Browser verification — sonnet balances thoroughness and token cost |

Override by setting these variables before invoking `/build`, or edit the defaults above.

## Prerequisites

Resolve the active spec branch first: list the `specs/` directory and pick the highest-numbered (latest) `NNN-<slug>` subfolder — that is `<latest-branch>`. All spec paths below use this root.

Verify these exist:
- `specs/<latest-branch>/prd.md`
- `specs/<latest-branch>/plan.md`
- `specs/<latest-branch>/data-model.md`
- `specs/<latest-branch>/tasks.md`

If any are missing, tell the user to run the upstream skills first (`/write-prd`, `/plan`, `/tasks`).

## Run state cache (write once at the start of the run)

Before the first phase, write `pipeline/run-state.md` so subagents do not re-discover what you already resolved. Overwrite any existing file:

```markdown
# Run State

**Run type**: build
**Started**: <current ISO timestamp>
**Spec branch**: specs/<latest-branch>
**Phase count**: <total phases in tasks.md>
**Has designs/**: yes | no
**Constitution path**: .claude/constitution.md

**Working tree at run start** (output of `git status --porcelain`):
```
<paste the bash output verbatim>
```
```

Run `git status --porcelain` once at startup and embed the output in the block above. This snapshot kills the most common waste pattern: the orchestrator re-querying git repeatedly throughout a phase ("did I commit this yet?", "which files am I touching?", "what's untracked?"). After the snapshot is written, refer back to it rather than re-running git status. Re-query only when you yourself have committed something (i.e. the tree state actually changed).

Update the per-phase detail at the start of each phase (append or rewrite the **Phase in progress** block):

```markdown
**Phase in progress**: Phase <N> — Cycle <C>
**Phase name**: <e.g. Persistence>
```

Subagents will read this file before any other discovery. Do not list `specs/` or otherwise re-validate facts that already live here.

### Orchestrator: keep state files in working memory, don't re-read between cycles

You (the build orchestrator) read `pipeline/run-state.md` and `pipeline/environment-facts.md` ONCE at the start of the run, then hold their contents in working memory for the rest of the /build session. Re-reading them at the top of every phase / cycle is pure waste — they are short, you already have them, and the only deltas come from:

- the per-phase "Phase in progress" block you write yourself (you know what you wrote)
- environment-facts corrections the developer subagent may log in their commit message ("Corrected environment-facts.md: <what>") — if you see such a message in the subagent return, re-read `environment-facts.md` then; otherwise do not

A previous /build run re-read `run-state.md` 10× and `environment-facts.md` 9× across one session (~72 KB of duplicate context). Stop after the first read; trust your context.

## Clean previous run artifacts (run once, before the first phase)

`pipeline/feedback/` and `pipeline/traces/` are per-run scratch space. Stale phase feedback files, screenshots, and JSONL traces from earlier builds are noise once a new run starts — they confuse the orchestrator when it scans for already-completed work, and they bloat trace digests with content from prior features. Run the cleanup helper once, before the first phase:

```bash
node .claude/scripts/clean-run-artifacts.mjs
```

The script wipes `pipeline/feedback/` and `pipeline/traces/` and leaves the persistent caches untouched (`build-log.md`, `environment-facts.md`, `procedures.md`, and `run-state.md` — the last is overwritten by the next orchestrator step anyway). Pass `--dry-run` to preview without touching the disk.

If the user has a reason to preserve a prior run's feedback, they should copy `pipeline/feedback/` somewhere safe before invoking `/build`.

## Process

Walk `specs/<latest-branch>/tasks.md` in order. For each phase that contains at least one unchecked `- [ ]` item, run the loop below. Phases whose items are all `- [x]` are skipped.

Per phase, max cycles: $MAX_CYCLES (default 5).

### Step 0 — Extract the phase block

Before invoking the developer or evaluator, extract just the lines for the phase in scope. Pass this as a fenced markdown block in both subagent prompts so neither has to re-read the full `tasks.md` every cycle — `tasks.md` typically runs 20–30 KB on a non-trivial feature, and re-reading it in both subagents on every cycle is pure waste.

```bash
PHASE_NUM=2  # the phase number in scope (reused by later steps)
node .claude/scripts/phase-block.mjs specs/<latest-branch>/tasks.md "$PHASE_NUM"
```

The output is the phase heading plus every `- [ ]` / `- [x]` task line under it, ending where the next `## ` heading starts. Hold this output as the **phase block**.

**Always use the script — do not hand-roll the extraction with `awk`/`grep`.** The script exists precisely because the inline awk it replaced was repeatedly retyped and mangled by the orchestrator (e.g. dropping the `$0` before `~`), which threw a syntax error and silently produced an empty block — indistinguishable from "no work to do". The script anchors on `## Phase N:` so Phase 5 never matches Phase 50, and exits non-zero (with a message on stderr) if phase N isn't found, so a typo'd phase number fails loudly instead of silently returning nothing.

### Step 0b — Slice large phases before dispatch

Count unchecked `- [ ]` tasks in the phase block with the same script:

```bash
UNCHECKED=$(node .claude/scripts/phase-block.mjs specs/<latest-branch>/tasks.md "$PHASE_NUM" --count)
```

If `UNCHECKED > $SLICE_THRESHOLD` (default `8`), do NOT dispatch the whole phase as one developer call. Single subagents stall on large phases — they run out of attention partway through, the orchestrator pays for a half-completed run, and the work has to be redone in slices anyway (this is exactly what happened in Phase 2 of `006-property-compliance-and-finance`, where a 13-file dispatch had to be split into 3 retroactively).

Instead, split the phase block into sequential developer dispatches:

1. **Group tasks into natural sub-sections** of ~4–6 unchecked tasks each. Prefer boundaries that match the work — all migrations together, all new repository files together, all schema work together, all route handlers together. Don't split a task and its sibling check across slices.
2. **Dispatch each slice as its own `developing-features` Agent call**, in order. Each call gets fresh context, so slice B's developer won't have slice A's working memory — that's fine, they'll see slice A's edits in `git diff HEAD` and on disk.
3. **Wait for each slice to return** before dispatching the next. The Agent tool blocks until the subagent finishes, so serial dispatch is automatic — don't try to parallelise slices, they share files.
4. **Pass the slice as the phase block** in the developer prompt, with a header line naming it (e.g. `### Slice A of 3: migrations`) so the developer knows it's a subset and won't panic about the missing tasks.
5. **After the last slice returns, proceed to Step 1b → Step 2 as normal**. The evaluator runs ONCE at the end against the **full** phase block, not per slice — slicing is a developer-side mitigation, the phase still has to pass as a whole.

If a slice fails (developer reports a blocker), stop and report; do not push on to the next slice. The phase-level retry loop (cycles 1..N) will pick the whole phase up again, and the orchestrator can re-slice differently next cycle if needed.

Skip this step when `UNCHECKED <= $SLICE_THRESHOLD`. The threshold is tunable per-project by setting `$SLICE_THRESHOLD` before invoking `/build`.

### Dispatch lock lifecycle (every Agent call)

Inside an active /build run the **`guard-orchestrator-discipline.mjs`** hook (installed by default since v0.19.0) refuses Bash invocations of dev/designs servers, `pixel-diff.mjs`, `dom-diff.mjs`, and the `run-*` wrappers from the orchestrator. It also refuses Edit/Write on `pipeline/dev-server-url` and `pipeline/designs-server-url`. The hook recognises a subagent context via a sentinel file: **`pipeline/dispatch-active.txt`**.

For **every** Agent call you make (developer, evaluator, and any slice dispatch), wrap the call:

```bash
# Open the dispatch lock — tell the guard the next forbidden tool call
# comes from a subagent, not from you.
printf '%s\n' "$(date -u +%FT%TZ) ${SUBAGENT_TYPE}" > pipeline/dispatch-active.txt
```

…then invoke the Agent tool. After it returns:

```bash
# Close the lock so the orchestrator is bound by the rules again.
rm -f pipeline/dispatch-active.txt
```

The lock has a 30-minute TTL inside the guard — long enough for a slow evaluator, short enough that a stale lock from a crashed run won't permanently disarm the guard. If you forget to open the lock, the subagent's first forbidden tool call is refused with a clear message that names you (the orchestrator) as the cause.

You may run **read-only** helpers without opening the lock:

- `node .claude/scripts/show-pixel-diff.mjs` — prints the verdict, failed routes, and top regions from `pipeline/feedback/pixel-diff.json`.
- `node .claude/scripts/show-dom-diff.mjs` — same for `pipeline/feedback/dom-diff.json`.
- `node .claude/scripts/ensure-servers.mjs [--designs]` — idempotent check; only starts a server if its URL marker is missing or unreachable. Calling this from the orchestrator is fine — it's a check, not a re-run.

Do **not** wrap your own `node -e '...'` / `python3 -c '...'` / `perl -e '...'` to extract one field from the JSON. The long-inline-script guard (extended in v0.19.0) refuses interpreter-agnostic blobs over 200 characters with a message pointing here. Use the helpers.

### Step 1 — Developer

Call the Agent tool with `subagent_type: "developing-features"` and `model: "sonnet"`. The prompt MUST include:
- Phase number, phase name, cycle number, spec branch
- A pointer to `pipeline/run-state.md`
- The phase block extracted in Step 0, as a fenced markdown block
- On retries: the path to the prior cycle's feedback file
- On retries: the **Carryovers list** copied verbatim from the prior cycle's feedback file, embedded as a fenced markdown block

#### Carryover extraction (retries only)

The evaluator writes a `## Carryovers (must fix next cycle)` section in every feedback file. On a retry, extract that block and paste it directly into the developer prompt — do not re-narrate it, do not summarise, do not reorder. The list is the operational contract:

```bash
PRIOR_FEEDBACK="pipeline/feedback/phase-${PHASE_NUM}-cycle-$((CYCLE - 1)).md"
awk '
  /^## Carryovers \(must fix next cycle\)/ { in_block = 1; next }
  in_block && /^## / { in_block = 0 }
  in_block
' "$PRIOR_FEEDBACK"
```

Embed the result in the developer prompt as:

```
## Carryovers from Phase [N] Cycle [C-1] (must fix BEFORE new tasks)

```
[paste carryover block here]
```

Fix every box above before any new phase task. Each box must be checked when you hand off — the next evaluator cycle will reject the phase if any are still open.
```

If the carryover block is empty (`_None — phase passes._`) but the orchestrator still scheduled a retry (e.g. score below threshold without High issues — uncommon but possible), fall back to passing the full feedback file path and let the developer infer.

### Step 1b — Verify environment facts gate

After the developer subagent returns and **before** invoking the evaluator, run:

```bash
node .claude/scripts/verify-environment-facts.mjs
```

This catches orphan dev-server processes the developer's `pkill` may have missed (commonly `next dev`, but the same pattern shows up with Vite, Remix, etc.) and wrong DB-path recordings in `pipeline/environment-facts.md`. **If it exits non-zero, do NOT invoke the evaluator** — log the failure and loop back to Step 1 with feedback to the developer. The developer should also have run this script in their own Step 4, but doing it here is defense in depth.

### Step 2 — Evaluator

Call the Agent tool with `subagent_type: "evaluating-phases"` and `model: "sonnet"`. The prompt should include the phase context AND the phase block — the agent file handles everything else:

```
Evaluate Phase [N] (<phase name>), Cycle [C].
Spec branch: specs/<latest-branch>/
Run state: pipeline/run-state.md
Procedures (login etc.): pipeline/procedures.md
Write feedback to: pipeline/feedback/phase-[N]-cycle-[C].md

Phase block (do not re-read tasks.md):
```
[paste the phase block here]
```
```

Do NOT add ToolSearch commands, browser rules, scoring rubrics, or verification steps to the prompt. The evaluator agent file has all of that.

### Step 3 — Check results

Read the evaluator's feedback file and output:

1. **Check for `<promise>BLOCKED</promise>` FIRST.** If present, extract the `<reason>...</reason>` body. Halt the entire build loop — do NOT invoke the next phase, do NOT retry, do NOT mark the current phase complete. Append a BLOCKED entry to `pipeline/build-log.md` (see Logging below) and print to the user:
   ```
   Build halted at Phase [N] Cycle [C] — BLOCKED.

   Reason: <reason body verbatim>

   The build cannot proceed without your input. See pipeline/feedback/phase-[N]-cycle-[C].md for full context, then re-invoke /build after the decision is made (e.g. tune `pixelDiff.maxDiffPct`, defer a route in `pixelDiff.routes`, update `prd.md` with an FR-###, etc.).
   ```
   Then exit /build cleanly. The user is in the driver's seat.

2. **Otherwise check for `<promise>COMPLETE</promise>` or `<promise>PERFECT</promise>` signals.**
3. **Also read the feedback file** — do NOT just check the signal:
   - If there are any **[High]** severity issues, the phase does NOT pass regardless of score. Loop back to Step 1.
   - If **Unresolved Issues** from a prior cycle are still listed, the phase does NOT pass. Loop back to Step 1.
4. PASS (signal present, no High issues, no unresolved carry-overs) → log success, move to next phase.
5. FAIL → log failure with specific issues, loop back to Step 1.

`BLOCKED` is checked first because it is mutually exclusive with all other outcomes — an evaluator that emits both `BLOCKED` and `COMPLETE` is malformed, and the BLOCKED state should win to keep the human in the loop.

## Logging

Append to `pipeline/build-log.md`:

```
Phase [N] — Cycle [C] — [Timestamp]

Developer: completed
Evaluator: PASS/FAIL/BLOCKED — Score X.X/10
High issues: [list any High severity items, or "none"]
Unresolved from prior: [list any, or "none"]
Verdict: [PASS — moving to next phase / FAIL — retrying with feedback / BLOCKED — <reason> — build halted, awaiting user]
```

## Failure handling

- After max cycles, write unresolved issues to `pipeline/build-log.md`
- Report to the user what's blocking and which issues could not be resolved
- **`BLOCKED` is not a failure** — it is a deliberate halt for a user decision (see Step 3). Do NOT count a BLOCKED cycle toward `$MAX_CYCLES`, and do NOT re-dispatch the developer on the same phase after a BLOCKED. The /build skill exits; the user re-runs /build after the decision is made.

## Rules

- **Never implement or evaluate yourself — always delegate.** This is Constitution Principle VIII (Scope Discipline) at the orchestrator level. Once you dispatch a developer or evaluator via the `Agent` tool, your scope is "wait for the return, then route the next step" — not "do the work inline while waiting". Concretely: between an `Agent` dispatch and its return, your ONLY allowed tool calls are read-only ones (Read the dispatched return, Read the feedback file the evaluator just wrote, status snapshots that don't mutate state). If you find yourself reaching for `Edit` / `Write` / `Bash` on source files mid-dispatch, stop. That's the developer's job, not yours. A real failure mode caught in the wild: orchestrator dispatched Slice A, then did Slices A-F's work itself inline, never invoked the evaluator, and committed checkboxes flipped without verification. Don't be that orchestrator.
- **Never run pixel-diff, dom-diff, or the dev/designs servers yourself.** The orchestrator-discipline guard (installed by default since v0.19.0) refuses those Bash calls outside the dispatch lock. The evaluator runs them — its outputs land on disk at `pipeline/feedback/pixel-diff.json` and `pipeline/feedback/dom-diff.json`. To read them, use `node .claude/scripts/show-pixel-diff.mjs` and `node .claude/scripts/show-dom-diff.mjs`. To check whether a server is up, use `node .claude/scripts/ensure-servers.mjs`. Don't re-implement these checks inline.
- **Do not edit specsmith tooling paths.** Edits to `.claude/scripts/`, `.claude/agents/`, `.claude/skills/`, `.claude/specsmith/`, or `templates/` are out-of-scope for a feature build per Constitution Principle VIII. The `guard-scope.mjs` hook (installed by default since v0.15.0) will refuse such edits with a clear message. If you need to change specsmith itself, that is a separate spec in the specsmith repository, not a side effect of this build.
- **Pre-existing convention violations are carryovers, not immediate work.** If `check-conventions.mjs` flags a file that was already over its line cap on `HEAD` (i.e. before this branch existed), record it in the carryover list of the current cycle's feedback file. Do NOT spend the current phase paging through the file and splitting it — that's a separate refactor spec.
- Each subagent gets fresh context automatically
- Pass `subagent_type` to the Agent tool: `"developing-features"` for developer, `"evaluating-phases"` for evaluator
- Keep the evaluator prompt minimal — only phase context. The agent file handles browser tools, rules, and scoring
- Pass the full feedback file path to the developer on retries
- A phase with unresolved High-severity issues NEVER passes, even if the score is above threshold
- If the evaluator's feedback has zero screenshots or says browser tools were unavailable, treat it as invalid and retry

## Design-fidelity issues are NEVER scope creep

This rule exists because of a real failure mode (Phase 4 of `002-landlord-dashboard`, 2026-05-15): the cycle-1 evaluator flagged a missing prototype region (a Portefeuille summary card present in `designs/dashboard.html` but absent from the implementation), and the orchestrator told the cycle-2 developer "do NOT add it — plan.md only enumerates 6 cards, this is scope creep." The phase then passed at 9.0/10 with the visual gap intact.

That was wrong. The prototype is the contract per the constitution's Design Fidelity principle. When `plan.md` and `designs/*.html` disagree about scope, the design wins for visual structure.

When you write the cycle-N+1 developer prompt:

- **NEVER** add an "explicitly out of scope" / "do NOT add" instruction for any item the evaluator flagged as a **design-fidelity gap** (missing prototype region, layout mismatch, structurally absent section). These are, by definition, in scope — the prototype defined the scope at `/design` time.
- If the evaluator flagged a missing region but the corresponding task is not in `tasks.md`, you have two options:
  1. **Preferred**: stop the loop, print "Design fidelity gap detected — `tasks.md` is missing tasks for prototype region(s) [...]. Re-run `/tasks` to merge in the missing regions, then re-invoke `/build`." Then exit without invoking another developer cycle. The user re-runs `/tasks` (which will merge in the orphan regions from `designs/coverage.md`) and re-invokes `/build`, which then continues the phase with the merged scope.
  2. **Acceptable** (when the gap is one or two items and re-running `/tasks` would be heavyweight): include the missing region in the next cycle's fix list AND in the same turn append the corresponding task(s) to `tasks.md` yourself with the Edit tool, so the evaluator's bookkeeping stays accurate.

The wrong move is the third option — telling the developer "don't bother, it's scope creep". Plan-vs-design tension is real, but it is resolved by updating the plan/tasks, not by ignoring the design.

The constitution's Design Fidelity principle is the tiebreaker, not `plan.md`'s files-to-touch table.
