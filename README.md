# specsmith

A bundle of [Claude Code](https://claude.com/code) skills, agents, and scripts that drive a feature from a vague idea to verified, browser-tested code.

You install it once into a project; from then on, building a feature is a sequence of slash commands. Each command produces a checked-in artifact (`prd.md`, `plan.md`, `data-model.md`, `tasks.md`) on its own git branch — so the work is reviewable, resumable, and version-controlled like any other code change.

## The pipeline

```
       /grill-me                  /write-prd                /plan                   /grill-plan                /tasks                  /design                /build
   (interrogate idea)        (synthesise PRD,        (Technical Context,        (pressure-test the         (decompose into          (HTML/CSS              (developer ↔

                              numbered folder)         Project Structure,         hidden complexity,         checkbox tasks)          designer ↔             evaluator
                                                       Files-to-touch)            failure modes)                                      design-critique)       checks tasks off)
                                                       + data-model.md
```

Five planning skills produce inspectable artifacts. Two execution skills (`/build`, `/design`) hand work to subagents and iterate until verification passes.

The artifacts for each feature live at `specs/NNN-<feature-slug>/` in the host project — first-class team documentation, not AI scratch.

## Requirements

- Node.js ≥ 18 (uses ESM and `fs.cpSync`)
- [Claude Code](https://claude.com/code) installed and on `PATH` (the installer uses the `claude` CLI to wire up Playwright MCP; if it's missing, the installer prints a manual snippet to add to `.mcp.json`)
- A git repository (each `/write-prd` invocation creates a new branch)

## Install

In the root of any project:

```bash
npx specsmith init
```

This:

1. Copies skills into `.claude/skills/` (one per skill, with bundled `templates/`)
2. Copies subagent definitions into `.claude/agents/`
3. Copies trace and helper scripts into `.claude/scripts/`
4. Drops a starter `.claude/constitution.md` (skipped if you already have one)
5. Merges baseline `.claude/settings.json` (permissions, additional directories, trace hooks) and `.claude/launch.json` (debug configurations) — your existing entries are preserved
6. Appends a "Real Dev Loop" section to your `CLAUDE.md` (created if missing)
7. Runs `claude mcp add --scope project playwright -- npx @playwright/mcp@latest --isolated` so the evaluator and design-critique agents can drive a real browser
8. Creates `pipeline/feedback/` and `pipeline/traces/` (runtime scratch space) and seeds `pipeline/procedures.md` with a starter overlay-handling procedure
9. Writes a checksummed manifest to `.claude/specsmith/manifest.json` so subsequent `update` runs know which files have been edited locally

Useful flags:

- `--dry-run` — preview without writing
- `--force` — overwrite locally-modified files (including `constitution.md`)

### About the permissions init grants

> **Heads up:** `init` adds `Bash(*)` to your `.claude/settings.json` allowlist (alongside `Read`, `Write`, `Edit`, `Glob`, `Grep`, `Agent`, and `mcp__playwright__*`) so the build and design loops aren't interrupted by per-command prompts during dev-server start/stop, `pkill`, `sed`/`awk` runs, test commands, migrations, etc. If your project requires tighter permissions, hand-edit `.claude/settings.json` after install — replace `Bash(*)` with specific patterns like `Bash(npm run *)`, `Bash(npx playwright *)`, `Bash(node .claude/scripts/*)` and so on. The trade-off is you'll start seeing prompts mid-loop when something the agents need wasn't allowlisted.
>
> Existing entries in `settings.json` are preserved — `init` only *adds* missing entries, it never removes yours.

### Per-project conventions (machine-checked)

Prose rules in agent files ("use Tailwind, no inline styles", "extract SVGs to icon components") get ignored when the developer agent has the prototype's HTML right in front of it and the prototype uses inline styles. specsmith's answer is the same one used by the runtime guard: a programmatic gate the developer must pass before handoff, not another paragraph in the agent prompt.

Opt in with:

```bash
npx specsmith init --conventions
```

This drops a starter `.claude/conventions.json` with four sensible default rules:

| Rule | What it catches |
| --- | --- |
| `no-inline-styles` | `style={...}` in `.tsx`/`.jsx` files when `tailwind.config.*` exists |
| `svg-extract` | inline `<svg>` blocks > 200 chars outside `src/components/icons/**` |
| `data-access-pattern` | direct DB/ORM calls (`db.select/.insert/.transaction/...`, `prisma.<model>.findUnique/.create/.update/...`) anywhere outside `src/lib/**/repository.ts` or `src/db/**` — explicitly catches the "called the database from a component / route handler / job" anti-pattern |
| `i18n-strings` | multi-word user-facing strings inlined in JSX or in a11y attributes (`placeholder`, `aria-label`, `title`, `alt`, `label`) |
| `component-size-cap` | component files (in `src/components/**`, `components/**`, `app/**`) exceeding 300 lines — proxy for "this component mixes concerns; extract a hook, selector, or sub-component" |

Each rule is a JSON object with `name`, `filesGlob`, optional `excludeGlob`, optional `forbiddenPattern` (JS regex), optional `maxLines` (file size cap; one of `forbiddenPattern` or `maxLines` must be set, both is fine too), optional `patternFlags`, optional `skipIfMissing` (rule no-ops if the named glob has no matches), and `message`. Edit, add, or remove rules to fit this project's standards. The schema is documented inline in the file.

Three integration points enforce the rules:

1. **`agents/developer.md` Step 4 gate 0**: `node .claude/scripts/check-conventions.mjs` runs *first* in the quality-gate sequence, before typecheck/test/lint. Failure blocks handoff.
2. **`agents/evaluator.md` Step 3 gate 0**: same script runs as a sanity check after the developer claims done. Any violation surfaces as automatic `[High]` in the feedback (machine-checkable, no judgment).
3. **`/plan`** detects convention ambiguity at planning time. If the codebase has competing patterns (e.g. some entities use `queries.ts`, others `repository.ts`) and no rule covers it, `/plan` raises an `OQ-###` so you pick one *and* add a rule — rather than letting the next plan pick the other and the codebase drift further.

Bypass per-run with `SPECSMITH_CONVENTIONS=0` in the environment. The script also no-ops gracefully when no `conventions.json` exists, so you can install specsmith without the flag and add conventions later by hand.

#### The `pixelDiff` block (visual fidelity, opt-in dependency)

`conventions.json` also ships with a `pixelDiff` block — a separate config (not a `rules[]` entry, because the check is browser-driven, not text-scanning). When enabled (default), the evaluator runs `node .claude/scripts/pixel-diff.mjs` during Step 2b: for each `designs/<slug>.html` prototype, both the prototype and the matching route on the dev server are opened in headless Chromium at the same viewport, diffed with `pixelmatch`, and the worst-offending pixel regions are reported back as `{x, y, w, h, intensity}` so the model gets *where* the implementation deviates, not just *how much*. The diff overlay PNG goes into `pipeline/feedback/` alongside the reference and actual screenshots.

When pixel-diff fires, it **replaces** the evaluator's older manual landmark snapshot comparison — pixel-diff is a strict superset (catches missing regions *and* layout / colour / typography deviations the snapshot comparison can't see). When it's not available (deps missing, designs server not running, `enabled: false`), the evaluator falls back to the manual comparison so the design-fidelity check still runs.

The runtime deps (`playwright`, `pixelmatch`, `pngjs`) are not bundled into specsmith — host projects that want pixel-diff install them themselves:

```bash
npm i -D playwright pixelmatch pngjs && npx playwright install chromium
```

The script skips gracefully with an install hint when any are missing, so leaving `pixelDiff.enabled: true` in projects that haven't installed the deps just no-ops — no error, no broken build. Tunable knobs in the `pixelDiff` block: `viewport`, `maxDiffPct` (default 5.0 since v0.10.0 — raised from 2.0 because real Next.js/Remix apps have ~3-6% irreducible drift vs static-HTML prototypes from font hinting, computed greetings, freshness timestamps, and live data), `threshold` (pixelmatch's `0..1`, default 0.1), `gridSize` (cell size for region bucketing, default 50 px), `masks` (CSS selectors for volatile content — timestamps, animations — applied via Playwright's `screenshot({ mask })`), and `routes` (override the default `designs/<slug>.html` ↔ `/<slug>` pairing).

The script also writes a `pixel-diff.json` file in the output directory and reads it on the next invocation to detect a plateaued diff. If every route's `diff_pct` moved less than 0.5pp from the prior run, the output payload includes `"stuck": true` plus a `stuck_reason` string suggesting three remediations (raise `maxDiffPct`, add masks, or accept the baseline). The evaluator emits `<promise>BLOCKED</promise>` on a plateau (see "Build signals" below) and the build orchestrator halts cleanly rather than asking the developer for another micro-edit cycle — the failure mode the flag exists to break is "agent burns N cycles trying to push 6.5% diff under a 2% threshold by tweaking seed data".

### Build signals

The evaluator communicates with the build orchestrator through one of four states:

| Signal | Meaning | Orchestrator action |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `<promise>PERFECT</promise>` | Entire feature done — every phase passes, all FRs satisfied, score 10/10 | Stop /build; feature complete |
| `<promise>COMPLETE</promise>` | This phase passes (score ≥ threshold, no High, no carryovers, all FRs for this phase met) | Move to next phase |
| `<promise>BLOCKED</promise><reason>...</reason>` (v0.12.0+) | A user decision is required — pixel-diff plateau, constitution waiver, unresolvable FR, etc. The reason names what specifically needs deciding | Halt /build, print `<reason>` to the user, exit cleanly. Re-run /build after the human resolves the question |
| no signal | Failure the developer can fix — High issues, unresolved carryovers, unmet FR-###, score below threshold | Loop back to the developer with feedback, up to `$MAX_CYCLES` |

`BLOCKED` is mutually exclusive with the pass signals. It exists so the orchestrator doesn't have to choose between "fake-pass a phase with a known gap" or "loop forever on something the developer can't fix" — the third path is "stop and ask the human". Common triggers: pixel-diff `stuck: true`, a `OQ-###` in `prd.md` the implementation can't resolve, a constitution principle that needs an explicit waiver decision.

#### Auth-protected routes (`storageStatePath`)

Most real apps redirect anonymous requests to `/login`. Without an authenticated browser context, every `actual`-side screenshot would just be the login page — and `diff_pct` against the real prototype would spike to 80–95% for every protected route. Since v0.11.0, `pixelDiff` supports a `storageStatePath` field (or `--storage-state <path>` on the CLI, which overrides the field):

```json
"pixelDiff": {
  "enabled": true,
  "storageStatePath": "pipeline/storage-state.json",
  ...
}
```

This is a [Playwright storageState JSON](https://playwright.dev/docs/auth) (cookies + localStorage). It's applied **only to the actual-side screenshot** — the reference side (designs/*.html on the static designs server) doesn't need auth, and injecting cookies into a same-origin redirect chain that doesn't expect them causes its own problems. If the path is set but the file doesn't exist when pixel-diff runs, the script skips with a clear reason rather than silently screenshotting the login page.

#### Per-route threshold overrides (`routeOverrides`)

When one route has irreducible drift the others don't — a dense detail page with spread micro-drift, a chart-heavy view, or a complex form — loosening the global `maxDiffPct` to accommodate it gives the other routes 4-5pp of slack they don't need. Since v0.13.0, `pixelDiff.routeOverrides` lets you set a higher floor per-route while keeping the global tight:

```json
"pixelDiff": {
  "maxDiffPct": 7.0,
  "routeOverrides": {
    "/contracts/[id]/indexation": { "maxDiffPct": 11.0 }
  }
}
```

Matching is by exact route key (as it appears in `routes`, or the default `/<slug>` for `designs/<slug>.html`). The output JSON tags overridden routes with `max_diff_pct_source: "routeOverride"` so the evaluator surfaces them explicitly. Keep the override list small — every entry is a noise floor that has to be remembered when reading future diffs.

#### Auth-wrapper pattern

The typical pattern is a project-local wrapper script (e.g. `scripts/run-pixel-diff.mjs`) that:
1. Reads dev-server URL from `pipeline/dev-server-url`
2. Spins up a Playwright browser, runs the project's login flow, writes `await context.storageState({ path: 'pipeline/storage-state.json' })`
3. Spawns `node .claude/scripts/pixel-diff.mjs --storage-state pipeline/storage-state.json --out pipeline/feedback` and forwards stdout/exit

The wrapper handles the project-specific bits (credentials, login form selectors, dynamic-route ID resolution); the upstream `pixel-diff.mjs` consumes the resulting storage state. This keeps specsmith free of host-project auth specifics while making auth-protected diffs a first-class concern.

### Closing the loop between /design and /build

The pipeline is `…/plan → /tasks → /design → /build`, and `/design` runs *after* `/tasks`. That order means the designer can introduce regions the plan didn't enumerate (e.g. a summary card the planner left out) and they'd silently disappear from `/build`'s scope unless `/tasks` knows about them.

specsmith closes this loop in three places:

1. **`agents/designer.md`** writes `designs/coverage.md` listing every prototype's top-level regions with stable component names. This is the machine-readable bridge between the designer and `/tasks`.
2. **`/design`** ends with a hand-off message telling you to re-run `/tasks` before `/build`. The recommended pipeline becomes: `/plan → /tasks → /design → /tasks → /build` (the second `/tasks` runs in *merge mode*, appending tasks for newly-introduced regions and preserving any `[x]` checkmarks from the first run).
3. **`agents/developer.md` Step 4 gate 0b** requires the developer to enumerate every region from `designs/coverage.md` (or the matching `designs/<slug>.html`) and check each one off in the handoff before declaring the phase ready. Catches the missing-region failure mode at source — one targeted edit instead of a full evaluator → developer round-trip.
4. **`agents/evaluator.md` Step 2b** runs `pixel-diff.mjs` (see the `pixelDiff` block above) to diff the rendered prototype against the rendered implementation pixel-for-pixel at the same viewport, reporting the worst-offending regions as coordinates + intensity. A failed diff is automatic `[High]` severity — no editorial judgment about "section vs detail". If the diff script is unavailable (deps not installed, server not running) the evaluator falls back to a manual accessibility-tree landmark comparison so the safety net still triggers if you skipped step 2 and went straight to `/build`.
5. **`/build`** explicitly forbids deferring design-fidelity issues as "scope creep". Plan-vs-design tension is resolved by updating the plan/tasks (re-run `/tasks`), never by ignoring the design.

Together these turn "the designer added something the plan didn't list" from a silent miss into either a merged task (best case) or a phase-blocking [High] (worst case).

### Phase-to-phase signal

Three rules in the evaluator make sure issues don't quietly carry forward across cycles:

1. **Carryover list.** Every feedback file ends with a `## Carryovers (must fix next cycle)` checkbox section. `/build` copies it verbatim into the next cycle's developer prompt — no re-narration, no summarisation. The developer knows exactly which boxes have to be `[x]` before handoff.
2. **Unmet `FR-###` hard-fails the phase.** A numbered functional requirement is the spec author's named promise to the user. If the implementation doesn't satisfy an FR-### the phase block was supposed to cover, the phase fails regardless of overall score — fixes the failure mode where rubric averaging hides a real spec violation.
3. **Auto-promote prior `[Med]` when scope grows.** If a prior cycle flagged a cross-cutting concern (provider, layout, i18n setup, error boundary) as `[Med]` and the current phase added new consumers of it, the evaluator escalates it to `[High]` for this cycle — fixes the failure mode where a "small login-only" issue becomes load-bearing the moment 5 new client components depend on it.

### Runtime guard against agent flailing

`init` installs `scripts/guard-repeat-commands.mjs` as a `PreToolUse` hook on every `Bash` call. It refuses two patterns mid-run rather than logging them after the fact (real /build traces showed agents falling into both, ignoring prose anti-patterns):

1. **Re-running an expensive command to re-filter output.** If `npm run test/lint/typecheck/build`, `playwright test`, `prisma migrate`, `tsc`, `jest`, `vitest`, `next build`, `cargo`, `go test`, `mvn`, or `gradle` already ran in this session and no `Edit` or `Write` tool call happened since, the second invocation is denied with a message pointing to `tee /tmp/last-out.txt` once, then grep the file. The "base" command is matched after stripping trailing `| grep/tail/head/awk/sed/wc/jq/...` pipes, so re-running with a different filter still counts as a repeat.
2. **State-wipe loops.** Three or more `rm -rf` of the same path (matching `pglite`, `.next`, `node_modules`, `data/`) within 30 minutes is denied. If the same failure persists after wiping, the bug isn't stale state.

**Bypassing the guard.** Set `SPECSMITH_GUARD_OVERRIDE=<reason>` (any non-empty value) in your shell BEFORE launching Claude Code if you want to disable both rules for a session. The override is honored only outside hook context (manual script invocation for testing); under a hook — which is every Claude Code Bash call — the override is **ignored** and the attempt is appended to `pipeline/traces/guard-bypass-attempts.log` for you to see. This closes the loophole earlier versions left open, where an agent could dodge the guard by exporting the env var in its bash session. To truly disable the guard for a session, remove the hook entry from `.claude/settings.json` instead of relying on the override var.

### Run the loops in an isolated environment

`Bash(*)` means a Claude Code session running in this project can execute *any* shell command the host user can run — including `git push`, reading `.env*` files, hitting your cloud provider CLIs, calling `gh` against your repos, and so on. For anything beyond a personal sandbox, run the loops in an environment with a smaller blast radius:

- **Dedicated SSH key for the agent**: generate a separate key that has push rights only to this repo, and remove the rest of your keys from `ssh-agent` while the loop runs. Limits how far an unintended `git push` can reach.
- **Docker / devcontainer**: run Claude Code inside a container with the project mounted read-write, your secrets *not* mounted, and outbound network restricted to the registries the project needs. The Playwright MCP container model handles the browser side; the agent process itself can be containerised the same way.
- **Service account on a server**: stand up a CI-style Linux user (no sudo, scoped credentials, dedicated ssh key, dedicated cloud-provider service account) and run the loops there over SSH. The agent's worst-case behaviour is bounded by what that user can do.

Whichever pattern, the rule of thumb is: assume the agent will at some point execute a command you didn't expect, and make sure that command can't reach anything you can't afford to lose.

## Edit the constitution

After install, edit `.claude/constitution.md` so it reflects this project's principles. The starter ships with seven broadly applicable principles (Test-First, Security-First, Code Quality & Complexity Control, Component Separation, Library-First, Migrations-Only, Design Fidelity); add, remove, or rewrite to fit.

`/plan` reads this file every time it generates a plan and renders one row per principle into a Constitution Check table — so vague principles produce vague checks. Be specific.

## Building a feature

```
You: /grill-me
     The customer keeps saying our checkout flow is "confusing" but won't say what.

Claude: <asks ~10 questions interactively — users, pain points, success criteria, edge cases, non-goals>

You: /write-prd
     <slug: checkout-revamp>

Claude: Allocates 003-checkout-revamp/, switches branch, writes specs/003-checkout-revamp/prd.md.

You: /plan

Claude: Inspects package.json + repo structure, reads prd.md and .claude/constitution.md,
        writes plan.md (Technical Context, Constitution Check, Project Structure,
        Files to touch) and data-model.md.

You: /grill-plan

Claude: <interrogates the plan: which constitution row is handwavy? which files-to-touch
        entry is missing? which migration looks safe but isn't? — produces punch list>

You: <hand-edits plan.md based on punch list>

You: /tasks

Claude: Writes tasks.md — phased markdown checkboxes, each implementation task paired
        with a sibling check task the evaluator runs.

You: /design     (optional, only if the feature needs visual prototypes)

Claude: Designer subagent generates HTML/CSS prototypes under designs/.
        Critique subagent scores them in a real browser. Loops until they pass.

You: /build

Claude: For each phase with unchecked tasks:
          - Developer subagent implements the phase
          - Evaluator subagent verifies via Playwright MCP, ticks off completed tasks
          - Loops until evaluator passes the phase
        Stops when every task in tasks.md is [x].
```

## Skills

| Skill | Purpose | Output |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `/grill-me` | Interrogate a fresh idea, customer feedback, bug report, or gripe | conversation only |
| `/write-prd` | Synthesise the conversation into a Product Requirements Document | new branch + `prd.md` |
| `/plan` | Translate the PRD into a technical plan and data model | `plan.md` + `data-model.md` |
| `/grill-plan` | Pressure-test an existing plan adversarially | conversation + punch list |
| `/tasks` | Decompose plan + data model into phased checkbox tasks | `tasks.md` |
| `/design` | Run designer ↔ critique loop until prototypes pass | HTML/CSS files in `designs/` |
| `/build` | Run developer ↔ evaluator loop until every task is checked off | implemented code, ticked `tasks.md` |

## Subagents

`/build` and `/design` are orchestrators — they delegate work to single-responsibility subagents that run in isolated context (the verifier never sees the implementer's reasoning):

| `subagent_type` | File | Role |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `developing-features` | `agents/developer.md` | Implements one phase; cares about clean code, tests, design fidelity |
| `evaluating-phases` | `agents/evaluator.md` | Verifies each task in a real browser via Playwright MCP; flips checkboxes only after passing |
| `designing-interfaces` | `agents/designer.md` | Generates distinctive HTML/CSS prototypes per user story |
| `critiquing-designs` | `agents/design-critique.md` | Scores prototypes against a rubric in a real browser |

The `subagent_type` values (left column) are what you pass to the Agent tool. The file basenames (`developer.md`, etc.) are not the invocation names.

```

`pipeline/procedures.md` and `pipeline/environment-facts.md` are **persistent caches** — they survive across runs and are never overwritten. The agents discover things once (login flow, dev-server port, test command) and write them here so future cycles skip the discovery step.

## Customising

- **Templates** for the file-writing skills live at `.claude/skills/<skill>/templates/<artifact>.md`. Edit them to change the structure of the PRD, plan, data-model, or tasks files. Your edits are preserved across `update` runs.
- **Subagent prompts** live at `.claude/agents/*.md`. Edit them to change how the developer or evaluator behaves. Edits are preserved across `update`.
- **Skill prompts** live at `.claude/skills/*/SKILL.md`. Edit similarly.
- **Constitution**: `.claude/constitution.md`. Never overwritten by `update`.

The manifest at `.claude/specsmith/manifest.json` records the SHA-256 of every file at install time. `update` compares package version vs on-disk vs manifest to decide whether each file is safe to update or has been customised — see "Updating" below.

## Updating

```bash
npx specsmith update
```

For each tracked file:

- **already current** (on-disk matches package) → skipped
- **unmodified since install** (on-disk matches manifest) → updated to package version
- **user-modified** (on-disk differs from both) → skipped, logged for manual reconciliation
- **missing on disk** → installed fresh

The constitution and your `pipeline/*.md` files are never touched.

`--dry-run` previews the diff without applying. `--force` (via `init --force`) overwrites everything including the constitution — use with care.

## Troubleshooting

**`claude: command not found` during init** — Claude Code isn't installed or isn't on PATH. The installer prints a `.mcp.json` snippet you can paste manually; everything else still installs.

**Update reports every file as user-modified on Windows** — line-ending normalisation. The package ships LF; if your repo has `core.autocrlf=true` you'll see CRLF on disk and the hashes diverge. The package ships a `.gitattributes` with `* text=auto eol=lf` to prevent this on its *own* tree, but for your host project run `git config core.autocrlf input` (or `false`) before installing.

**`/plan` complains the constitution is missing** — `.claude/constitution.md` was deleted or `init` was skipped. Run `npx specsmith init` again (it will only re-add what's missing).

**Evaluator can't drive the browser** — Playwright MCP wasn't wired. Check `.mcp.json` has the `playwright` entry; if not, run `claude mcp add --scope project playwright -- npx @playwright/mcp@latest --isolated`.

**`/grill-plan` says it can't find the plan** — you're not on a feature branch. The `^\d{3}-` branch pattern is how the post-PRD skills locate the spec folder. Either `git checkout` the right branch, or tell the skill which spec folder to use when it asks.

## Design decisions worth knowing

- **No transcript file from `/grill-me`.** The conversation context *is* the handoff, so `/write-prd` must run in the same session as `/grill-me`.
- **Plan is detailed but not SpecKit-detailed.** `/plan` produces only `plan.md` + `data-model.md` — no `research.md`, `quickstart.md`, or `contracts/`. The plan template has Technical Context, Constitution Check, Project Structure, and Files-to-touch sections.
- **Tasks are not agent-bound.** Tasks have no `(dev)` / `(design)` tags. The orchestrator routes; the evaluator decides "done".
- **Numbering is stable.** `FR-###`, `NFR-###`, `SC-###`, `OQ-###` identifiers in `prd.md` are append-only — never renumber when adding items.
- **Each feature gets its own branch.** `/write-prd` runs `git checkout -b NNN-<slug>` off whatever branch you're on, inheriting any uncommitted changes. Multiple features in flight = multiple branches.
